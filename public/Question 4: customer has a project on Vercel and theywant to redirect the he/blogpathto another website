# Response to Customer Request for Redirecting /blog Path

Dear Customer,

Thank you for reaching out with your request to redirect the /blog path to another website on your Vercel project. I'm here to guide you through the process.

To set up the redirect, please follow these steps:

1. Open your project's root directory and locate the vercel.json file. If the file doesn't exist, create a new file with that name.

2. Inside the vercel.json file, add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/blog",
      "destination": "https://example.com/blog",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
Replace "https://example.com/blog" with the URL of the website you want to redirect to.

The "permanent": true option tells Vercel to use a 308 permanent redirect, which is recommended for permanent redirects. If you want a temporary redirect, you can change it to "permanent": false.

Save the vercel.json file.

If your project is already deployed on Vercel, you can redeploy it by running the following command in your terminal:
vercel --prod
This command will push the updated configuration to your Vercel deployment.

Once deployed, any requests to your project's /blog path will be permanently redirected to the specified website.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm here to provide additional guidance or troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
