# Choosing Between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware

Dear Customer,

Thank you for your question regarding the different function types available on the Vercel platform. Choosing the right function type depends on your specific use case and requirements. Here's a brief overview of when to use each type:

**Edge Functions:**
- Edge Functions are recommended when you need to handle dynamic requests or perform computations close to the user's location. They are executed at Vercel's globally distributed Edge Network, providing low latency and high performance. Use Edge Functions for tasks such as:
  - Transforming or manipulating responses (e.g., header injection, content manipulation)
  - Handling dynamic redirects or rewrites
  - Enforcing security policies (e.g., rate limiting, IP filtering)
  - Implementing serverless APIs with low latency

**Serverless Functions:**
- Serverless Functions are designed for server-side operations that require more compute power or longer execution times. They are executed in a centralized environment and are suitable for tasks such as:
  - Interacting with databases or external APIs
  - Handling long-running or resource-intensive computations
  - Processing background jobs or scheduled tasks
  - Implementing server-side APIs or webhooks

**Edge Middleware:**
- Edge Middleware provides a way to intercept incoming requests and perform actions before they reach your application. It is particularly useful for handling cross-cutting concerns or applying global policies. Some use cases for Edge Middleware include:
  - Implementing authentication or authorization mechanisms
  - Logging or monitoring incoming requests
  - Handling CORS headers or other security policies
  - Modifying requests or responses based on specific rules

When deciding which function type to use, consider factors such as the nature of the task, performance requirements, and the need for global distribution or server-side operations. Edge Functions are ideal for low-latency, dynamic tasks, while Serverless Functions are better suited for server-side operations and long-running tasks. Edge Middleware can be used to apply global policies or handle cross-cutting concerns.

If you have a specific use case in mind, feel free to provide more details, and I'll be happy to provide a more tailored recommendation.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Customer Success Manager, Vercel
